A chess piece set inspired by the popular Chess Alpha set by Eric Bentzen. The name Ansuz refers to the rune in Elder Futhark which corresponds to roughly the same sound as the Greek letter alpha.

## Files

The pieces of the default set are located in the `pieces` folder, and alternative versions of the bishops and kings can be found inside `pieces_alt`. The file `Ansuz.svg` in the `res` folder is a multi-page Inkscape document containing all the pieces.
